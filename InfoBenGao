              <p class= "paragraphContent">Thought at first saving your money seems like an easy task, after going at it for a bit, it reveals itself as this horrible impossible requiring infinite willpower and mental fortitude. Not to worry, things like this need only an organized process and practice.</p>

                <h2 class= "ssl">Set Spending Limits</h2>
                <p class= "sslp">Limiting your spending is one of the most helpful things you can do for one main reason, it stabilizes spending. One of the most annoying things to deal with is inconsistency in an account. It makes it so that you must plan for a lot more than you need to. If your spending becomes consistent, or at the very least, predictable, then it’s easier to keep track of your money and harder to overspend. You should be setting your limit based upon your income so you don’t lose money over time but have a little bit left over.</p>
                <h2 class= "ssl">Regular Savings</h2>
                <p class= "sslp">Saving money regularly is key in preparing for the future. History is full of examples of people spending their money as fast as they earn it. Countless lottery winners went bankrupt within months just because of their unwise spending. Though this example doesn’t apply to us nonmillionaires, we do need to keep in mind to spend our money at a slower rate than we make it. That way, we gain money overall instead of losing it. Savings accounts should see very little withdraws. It’s always a good idea to save money to prepare for random expenses. Certain things like property damage happen and there’s no way to predict when they will happen. A savings account prepares for these things while not having to predict them either.</p>
