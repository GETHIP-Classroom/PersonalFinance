                <li>Set Spending Limits</li>
                    <ul>Limiting your spending is one of the most helpful things you can do for one main reason, it stabilizes spending. One of the most annoying things to deal with is inconsistency in an account. It makes it so that you must plan for a lot more than you need to. If your spending becomes consistent, or at the very least, predictable, then it’s easier to keep track of your money and harder to overspend. You should be setting your limit based upon your income so you don’t lose money over time but have a little bit left over.</ul>
                <li>Regular Savings</li>
                    <ul>Saving money regularly is key in preparing for the future. History is full of examples of people spending their money as fast as they earn it. Countless lottery winners went bankrupt within months just because of their unwise spending. Though this example doesn’t apply to us nonmillionaires, we do need to keep in mind to spend our money at a slower rate than we make it. That way, we gain money overall instead of losing it. Savings accounts should see very little withdraws. It’s always a good idea to save money to prepare for random expenses. Certain things like property damage happen and there’s no way to predict when they will happen. A savings account prepares for these things while not having to predict them either.</ul>
                <li>Retirement Fund</li>
                    <ul>No matter what age you are, it's never to early to start saving for retirement. The earlier you start, the more benefits that come along with it. This includes, better habit, more security and overall a healthier future. If you are a fulltime employee, most jobs offer some type of matching system. Basically, employers may offert to match up to 50% of your contributions. So if one saved $2,500, then the employer would match that with another $1,250. Don't leave free money on the table!</ul>
                <li>Cut Unneccesary Spending</li>
                    <ul>Impulse buying is one of the major sources of unneccesary spending. Whether it be snacks from the store or even those new shoes, making the choice to save that money will pay off in the long run. One way you can do this is by making a list everytime you go to the store. This will eliminate chances of you buying things you don't need. Another tip is to remove your debit card from online sites. By doing this, you will be less likely to make random purchases because you have to enter the information every time. Follow this and other tips to make sure you stay on budget!</ul>
